    <!-- <p>Recent advances in text-to-speech, particularly those based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly improved the expressiveness of short-form synthetic speech. However, generating human-parity long-form speech with high dynamic prosodic variations is still challenging. To address this problem, we expand the capabilities of GNNs with a hierarchical prosody modeling approach, named HiGNN-TTS. Specifically, we add a virtual global node in the graph to strengthen the interconnection of word nodes and introduce a contextual attention mechanism to broaden the prosody modeling scope of GNNs from intra-sentence to inter-sentence. Additionally, we perform hierarchical supervision from acoustic prosody on each node of the graph to capture the prosodic variations with a high dynamic range. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of HiGNN-TTS in learning hierarchical prosody. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that HiGNN-TTS significantly improves the naturalness and expressiveness of long-form synthetic speech.</p> -->

Taking a lotus seedpod from the small boat, she hurled it toward the man's head. The distance between the small boat and the strange guest was several zhangs (a Chinese measurement unit), and although Lu Wushuang was young, her strength was surprisingly strong, and the throw was quite accurate. "Cousin!" Although they wanted to stop her, it was too late. They saw the lotus seedpod fly straight toward the strange man's face. The strange man tilted his head back and caught the lotus seedpod in his mouth. Instead of reaching for it, he rolled his tongue around it and started chewing on it. The five girls saw that he couldn't peel out the lotus seeds and didn't mind the bitterness, so they started eating the lotus seedpods, petals and all.`],

Beijing's autumn nights were somewhat desolate, and the temperature difference between inside and outside the barbecue restaurant caused dense beads of water to form on the windows. Luozhi tentatively picked up a glass of wine and gulped it down. Everyone present was unloved, not as fearless and brave as they seemed, but could only drink to show a little respect. In the world, there always exists a kind of person who is an irony to ordinary and mediocre people. For example, Sheng Huainan. "By the way, you and his ex-girlfriend were classmates, right?"
